# Example Game

This is a simple example game that uses [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) to
demonstrate a project that spans multiple files and showcases some game
programming concepts used in idiomatic Tomo code. It also showcases how to
interact with an external C library. To run the game:

```bash
tomo game.tm
```

An example [Makefile](Makefile) is also provided if you want to use `make` to
build the game and `make clean` to clean up the built files.
